This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(Distance)

nests <- read.csv(file = "https://workshops.distancesampling.org/online-course/exercisepdfs/Ch7/datasets/ducks-area-effort.csv",
header = TRUE)

head(nests, n=2)
tail(nests, n=2)
dim(nests)

summary(nests$distance)
hist(nests$distance, xlab = "Distance (m)")


```


The convert.units argument ensures that the correct units are specified - in this example, distances are in metres, lengths in km and the area in km2. Think of this argument as a divider used to transform units of transect effort into units of perpendicular distance (e.g., 1km / 0.001 = 1000m).
```{r}
nest.model1 <- ds(nests, key = "hn", adjustment = NULL,
convert.units = 0.001)
summary(nest.model1$ddf)

#Plot the detection function with the histogram having 12 bins:
plot(nest.model1, nc = 12)


nest.model2 <- ds(nests, key = "hn", adjustment = "cos",
convert.units = 0.001)
plot(nest.model2, nc = 12)

```

Fit a hazard rate key function
```{r}
nest.model3 <- ds(nests, key = "hr", adjustment = "herm",
convert.units = 0.001)
summary(nest.model3$ddf)
```

The objects created with ds (e.g. nest.model1) are made up of two parts.
We can list them using the names function as below:

```{r}
names(nest.model1)
names(nest.model1$ddf)

```

Assess the model using goodness of fit
Calling the function gof_ds with the default arguments and exact distance data, a q-q plot is produced along with the unweighted Cramer-von Mises goodness of fit test.
```{r}
gof_ds(nest.model1)

```
8 Estimating density and abundance
So far, we have concentrated on the detection function but, with more information such as transect lengths and the area of the region, we can estimate
density and abundance. The second component of a ds object, contains this
additional information. This information can be viewed with:
```{r}
str(nest.model1$dht$individuals, max = 1)

#Look at the summary table
nest.model1$dht$individuals$summary

#Abundance estimates, estimate density multiplied by the size of the study area
nest.model1$dht$individuals$N
nest.model1$dht$individuals$D
nest.model3$dht$individuals$N #hazard rate fxn
nest.model3$dht$individuals$D #hazard rate model has 1.1 less nests than the half-normal model

```
